Build sites with AI via MCP (Cursor, Claude). 30+ Gutenberg blocks, Class Manager, and review & Accept in the editor.

== Description ==

**Blockish connects MCP-compatible AI assistants to the Block Editor** so you can design real WordPress layouts with natural language — not just edit posts or run admin tasks.

Connect Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or another MCP client, then ask for a section or page. Blockish gives the AI **30+ structured Gutenberg blocks** and a **Class Manager** for reusable CSS, so generated layouts stay clean, responsive, and editable in the native block sidebar.

You can still build manually. When AI helps, you review an inline preview and Accept before anything goes live.

= AI Site Building Workflow =
1. **Connect:** Use the 1-click config wizard to connect your site to an MCP-enabled AI client (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, etc.).
2. **Prompt:** Tell your AI what kind of page or section you need.
3. **Generate:** The AI builds with Blockish blocks directly in the Gutenberg editor.
4. **Refine:** Review the inline preview and Accept, or ask for tweaks to colors, spacing, and typography.

== Why Blockish Blocks are Different ==

Blockish is built so both humans and AI assistants can work in the same Gutenberg canvas:

* **Clean Architecture:** Semantic, predictable block structures that AI tools can reason about reliably.

* **Class Manager System:** Create and apply reusable CSS classes instead of one-off inline styles — cleaner markup and a consistent design system.

* **Theme.json Integration:** Update global typography and colors through MCP abilities.

* **Human-Friendly:** After generation, edit everything with standard Gutenberg sidebars.

== Powerful Features ==

* **Template Library:** 1-click page and pattern import in the Block Editor.
* **Magic Login:** Secure 1-click login from your AI agent.
* **EditorSync:** Keep the open editor in sync when the AI stages changes.
* **Interactions:** Entrance presets, emit/listen signals, custom JS, plus page-level and global libraries.
* **Visibility:** Hide blocks per device (desktop / tablet / mobile) without custom CSS.
* **Add-ons hub:** Discover companion products (Forms, Dynamicity) from the Blockish dashboard.

== 30+ AI-Optimized Blocks ==

Built for AI-assisted design — and fully usable for manual site building:

= Layout =

* **Container** — Flexible section wrapper with background, spacing, flexbox/grid, and layout controls.

* **Carousel** — InnerBlocks carousel for heroes, testimonials, and logo strips (with Carousel Slide children).

* **Before/After Slider** — Interactive image comparison with a draggable handle.

= Typography =

* **Heading** — Customizable headings with typography, colors, and shadow options.

* **Paragraph** — Paragraph block with advanced typography and spacing controls.

= Media =

* **Image** — Image block with overlay, border, mask, alignment, and optional lightbox.

* **Video** — Embed and style videos with custom play buttons and wrapper controls.

* **Icon** — Scalable SVG icons with color, size, and hover effects.

= Theme & Query =

* **Site Title / Tagline / Logo** — Site identity blocks for headers and footers.

* **Post Title / Excerpt / Content / Featured Image / Post Info** — Single-post and loop-ready content blocks.

* **Query Title / Query Total / Archive Description** — Archive and search context blocks.

= Interactive =

* **Accordion** — Collapsible content sections for FAQs, features, and more.

* **Tab** — Tabbed content panels for organizing information.

* **Navigation** — Flexible navigation for headers (nav menu, items, submenu, offcanvas).

* **Offcanvas** — Slide-out panel for menus, filters, and secondary content.

= Data & Stats =

* **Counter** — Animated number counter for statistics and milestones.

* **Progress Bar** — Progress bars with labels, colors, and animations.

* **Rating** — Star rating display for reviews and testimonials.

= Lists & Icons =

* **Icon List** — Icon-based lists instead of plain bullets.

= Social & CTA =

* **Social Icons** — Social links with shapes, colors, and sizes.

* **Button** — Call-to-action buttons with hover effects and icons.

= Maps =

* **Google Map** — Embed maps with zoom, height, and location settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/blockish` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Blockish -> MCP Server** in your dashboard to generate your AI connection command!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the MCP AI Engine? =

Blockish includes a native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Connect an MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) to generate and style Gutenberg layouts with natural language.

= Do I need a separate page builder? =

No. Blockish extends the native Gutenberg editor with layout blocks and styling controls. With an AI assistant connected over MCP, you can design full sections and pages without a third-party page builder.

= What is the Class Manager? =

The Class Manager lets you (and the AI) create, edit, and apply reusable CSS classes in the editor — a consistent design system without messy one-off styles.

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes. Core Blockish is free on unlimited personal or client sites. Optional add-ons (such as Forms and Dynamicity) add forms and dynamic query/loop features when you need them.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to external services under the conditions described below. No data is ever sent without a clear user action or explicit opt-in.

= 1. Freemius (freemius.com) =

**What it does:** Powers optional product opt-in, licensing for companion add-ons (such as Forms and Dynamicity), software updates, and anonymous usage insights that help improve Blockish. This uses the Freemius WordPress SDK bundled with the plugin.

**When it connects:** **Only if you explicitly opt in** (or activate a license) when Freemius prompts you in wp-admin. Skipping or declining opt-in means no Freemius analytics/licensing traffic for that flow. You can change your opt-in / license status later from the Blockish dashboard (Addons) or Freemius account controls.

**Data sent:** Non-sensitive environment and product data typical of Freemius (for example plugin version, WordPress version, site URL, and similar technical details used for licensing, updates, and insights). No passwords or post content are sent as part of this integration.

* Improved: PHPCS/WPCS configuration — focus on security and compatibility checks; skip formatting-only sniffs
* Fixed: PHP 7.4 compatibility in MCP Json Helper (removed union return type)
* Fixed: Prepared SQL, exception escaping, and empty-code hygiene across MCP callbacks and AI Preview
* Fixed: Magic Login redirect encoding (no double urlencode; `add_query_arg` handles encoding)

* Added: Class Manager control search — match panel titles and labels, sticky header, compact scrollable panel
* Added: Panel change dots on inspector and Class Manager when a section has non-default stored values
* Improved: Change dots ignore nested values when their controlling condition is off (hidden controls no longer look “dirty”)

= 1.2.4 =

* Added: Accept / Discard from the Settings list, including multi-select and bulk actions
* Added: Accepting a page from Settings also unwraps nested staged patterns and forms
* Added: Class Manager previous-content snapshots so Accept keeps live CSS and Discard restores the pre-AI stylesheet (or removes a class created in that cycle)
